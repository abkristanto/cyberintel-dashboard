# Cyberintel Dashboard
This project displays the results and analysis of scraping results acquired from several top cybersecurity news websites. The goal of this project is to provide an easy to access interface that filters out certain cybersecurity topics that are relevant, avoiding spending precious time scrolling through news websites trying to find the most relevant news. Because let's face it, neither you nor I have the time to browse three or four separate websites to just get latest scoop on your favorite cybersecurity topic. 

This project leverages auto keyword-based tagging and results can be tag-filtered by clicking on a certain topic beneath the article or clicking on the bar chart to the right of the articles showing a distribution of the most prevalent topics. 

# Roadmap
Later iterations plan to include user-based features to allow for connecting artificial intelligence for news inference and the ability to customize certain keywords or topics a user might want to see in their feed.
